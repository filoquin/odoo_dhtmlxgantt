# odoo_dhtmlxgantt
Integration of DHX's Gantt chart in to Odoo
The goal of this project is a full integration of the Gantt chart with Odoo. 
Since Gantt chart is an essential tool for project management.
Including one in Odoo will make it compete with older and more fully featured Project Management applications.

Companies who's main work is projects like construction companies, tend to not accept Odoo easily over other well known PM apps.
Thus it must be done sooner or later to enter that market (Project Management).

This module is not perfect, please test it first before using it for production :)

# Know Issues
Sometimes changing the datetime fields do not consider the timezone :(

Todo: make calculations for weekend.
